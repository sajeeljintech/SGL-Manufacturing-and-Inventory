## Wrapping the PVC Tube

* Note both ends of the Unwrapped Tube
  * One end is slightly carved out with no threading. This end is the TOP
  * The other side has not been carved out and it set with some threading.

</div>

* Begin by unwrapping the PVC Tube from the top with the Hockey Tape. Wrap diagonally, starting from above the tube, covering about 5mm of the previous wrap as you go down and around the Tube

</div>

* Snip off the Roll, then cut the excess tape from the top and the bottom of the now Wrapped PVC Tube. Do not worry about the ends of the tape connecting over the holes, this will help later.

</div>

* Using some tool (in this instance it is the blunt end of the exacto-knife), press the excess tape down into the tubing. This will leave a nice flat rim of tape around the ends of the Tube.

</div>

* With the exacto-knife, slice away the excess tape inside the tube, then set aside for now

## Button Assembly

* Begin by cutting off the extra cable, leaving the whole button and cable at 5cm. Strip the last 5mm of the two cables. Then remove the bold and washer attached to the Button.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2591.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Total button, without removed washer and cables stripped</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* Place the Crimp Splicers on both ends of the stripped cable. Then, using the wire strippers, crimp the end of the Splicer to the exposed cables. Then set aside for later.
* Try not to over crimp the Splicer so the other end can enter the Splicer easily.

</div>

## Cable Order

* For the Aux Pigtail, you will need to slide the different parts down the cable in a certain order in order to properly assemble to Handheld Trigger Button. There are images to coincide with the steps below:

1. 3.5mm Heat Shrink Tubing
2. PG7 Gland (with plastic nut removed)
3. Wrapped PVC Tubing (bottom down)
4. 4-4.5mm Heat Shrink Tubing (pictured <mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark>)

</div>

## Splicing Aux Cable to Button

* Separate the Red and Black Cables and trip the ends of the cables.
  * There is a small amount of factory solder on the cable, although it is not necessary and may be removed when stripped, but it may be useful when threading the cable through the Splicer.
* Thread the stripped cables into the respective colored cables on the Button Assembly from earlier. Crimp the entire Splicer once the cables are set.

* Using the heat gun, shrink the tubing of the Splicer to secure it to the cables

</div>

* Pull the Blue 4-4.5mm Heat Shrink Tubing up to the Splicers and shrink it to the two (pictured below) Splicers.
* Once cool, you should have an assembly like the image below.

## Assembling the Full Cable

* Begin by applying a smaller dab of glue to the underside of the button. Then slowly lower it to the tube, rotating it to cover the whole of the tube's interior.
* Slice away any excess hot glue that squeezes out from the lip of the button.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2608.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hot glue applying to the button.</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2609.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The glue pressed firmly to the tube</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2610.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cleaned up top of the Handheld Trigger Button</p></figcaption></figure>

* Apply a substantive amount of hot glue down the barrel of the tube, filling the inside and fitting the cable in-place inside the tube.
* Then, make sure there is a small sab of glue on the threads inside the tube, so that the PG7 Gland both has something to thread to and it secured in place.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2613.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Small dab of glue being placed on the threading</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* Quickly move the PG7 Gland up the cable and thread it into the tube.
  * Remove the two parts of the PG7 Gland, using the threaded end for this step (pictured below)
  * Make sure the gland itself is being twisted into place. Not the cable, and not the tube.
* Slide the 3.5mm Heat Shrink tube into the PG7 Gland about halfway to 2/3 of the way down the tube with a portion of the Shrink Tube exposed.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2615.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>3.5mm Heat Shrink Tubing moved into place with the PG7 Gland part ready for threading.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* Screw down the remaining part of the PG7 Gland onto the Heat Shrink tubing, making sure the hot glue has cooled down enough to not move the gland threaded inside the PVC Tubing

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2616.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Partially threaded down onto the Gland and Tubing</p></figcaption></figure>

* Next, apply heat to the 3.5mm Heat Shrink Tube. Once the entire assembly has been cooled, apply a cable tie (velcro tie pictured below). Then, the assembly for the Handheld Trigger Button has been completed and is ready for testing and shipment!
