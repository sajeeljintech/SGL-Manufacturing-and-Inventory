# 3️⃣ Part 3: Closing the Case

## The Back of the Argon

* To finish the Yodeck Player, we will need to finish closing the Argon Case and adding the last details that make the device a Yodeck. Remove the protective plastic from the bottom of the Argon Case that had been set aside from the beginning of [Part 1 - Opening the Argon](part-1-argon-case-and-the-daughter-board.md).
* On the bottom of the case, there is a small cutout designed to fit over the _<mark style="color:red;">Micro SD Card Reader</mark>_ on the Raspberry Pi, carefully place the case cover over the reader and aligned with the shape of the Argon. The case should fall into place easily when put in the proper way.

## Threading Screws and Inserting a Micro SD Card

* Next, grab the remaining 4 Large Case Screws from [Part 2 - Adding the Thermal Pads](part-2-installing-the-pi.md) and begin threading one into a corner of your choosing.

* Once the first Large Case Screw has been added to the Argon Case, move diagonally to the next screw hole and thread in the next, working around the case until the bottom of the case has been fully secured.
* Now that the bottom of the Argon Case has been finished, you may take your Flashed Micro SD Card and insert it into the device (as shown below).

## Applying Rubber Feet

* The easiest part of the build; applying the Rubber Feet is incredibly easy. Begin by using the Tweezers to remove a foot from the adhesive pad and place it firmly in one of the 4 plastic circles on the bottom of the case.

* With the Rubber Feet placed, the Yodeck Player has been built, now to add stickers and finish the build in Part 4.
