# 2️⃣ Part 2: Installing the Pi

## Adding the Thermal Pads

* With the Argon Case being made of metal and the harsh conditions our Pi's go through, it is important to regulate the temperature of the Pi itself. Begin by separating the different parts included in the Anti-Static Bag: 2 _<mark style="color:red;">Thermal Pads</mark>_, a set of _<mark style="color:red;">Rubber Feet</mark>_, 4 _<mark style="color:red;">Long Case Screws</mark>_, and 4 _<mark style="color:red;">Small Board Screws</mark>_.
* Select one of the two fragile Thermal Pads and remove the protective plastic on one side, making sure the pad does not stick to anything or tear in the process.

* Place the sticky side of the Thermal Pad to one of the 2 tall metal posts to the right of the Argon Case's fan. These are heat-sinks made to cool some of the chips on the Raspberry Pi.
* Firmly press the Thermal Pad into the heat-sink with your finger, then remove the protective plastic on the other side of the pad as it sticks to the post (as shown below).
* Repeat for the other Thermal Pad on the other post.

## Seating the Pi

* Next in the process is adding the Pi Assembly to the Argon Case. The proper process starts with aligning the Pi Assembly's many ports to the holes made in the back of the Argon Case (as shown below).
* It is very important to make sure all of the 40 GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi 4 all line up with the 40 pin socket located on the right side of the top of the case. You should be left with a flush Pi Assembly set firmly into Argon Case with no crooked ports.

### Switching Power to Always On

* In order to keep things simple for our operators, we will need to set the case from its' default power setting to "Always On" This is down by removing the small Power Bridge from the 3 pins in the open space of the case (as show below).
* Move the Bridge from pins <mark style="background-color:yellow;">1 and 2</mark> to <mark style="background-color:green;">2 and 3</mark> so that when the Case is plugged into power, the Pi will power on immediately instead of needing the Power Button to be pressed.

## Screwing Down the Boards

* Securing the Pi Assembly to the Argon Case starts by grabbing the 4 Small Board Screws we had set aside from the Anti-Static Bag.

* Below are the 4 locations these small screws should be threaded into: Start with the top left, then diagonally to the bottom right. Continue with the last 2, making sure to tighten down all Board Screws down evenly as to make sure the Pi Assembly's ports remain un-crooked.
