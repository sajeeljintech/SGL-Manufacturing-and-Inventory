  Most of our Pi 4 based nodes are built inside of the same Argon Pi 4 V2 Case.
  Here is how to install the Pi for any of our nodes:

# 1️⃣ Part 1: Argon Case and the Daughter Board

## Opening the Argon

* In order to build a Timer Node, we will need a solid case to keep the Pi safe and allow for ease use with most monitors. Begin by removing the _<mark style="color:red;">Argon Pi 4 V2</mark>_ _<mark style="color:red;">Case</mark>_ from it's box and separating all of the parts out individually. Included should be the top and bottom of the case, a n _<mark style="color:red;">Anti-Atatic Bag</mark>_ of various parts, and a small black _<mark style="color:red;">Daughter Board</mark>_.

## Connecting the Pi

* Start by removing the Pi from its red box, and set it down with the Daughter Board from the Argon Case. Then line up the Daughter Board so that the 2 HDMI mini ports on the left side of the Pi and the 3.5mm jack are connected together flush.
* There may be a little crunch sound as you press the two boards together, this is okay and does not mean anything is broken. Once set, you will have one completed _<mark style="color:red;">Pi Assembly</mark>_. Set it with the top of the Argon Case and move onto [Part 2 - Installing the Pi](../../yodeck-player/building-the-yodeck-player/part-2-installing-the-pi.md).
