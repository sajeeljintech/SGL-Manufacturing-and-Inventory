# 0Ô∏è Part 0: Preparation and Flashing a New SD Card

## Preparation

* To begin registering the V2 Button Box, we have a few things to prepare before going right in:
* Start by making sure you have access to a camera that is able to output via SDI that is charging since we will be at this for a little while. We use a JVC HC500 to get the job done. (as shown below)

* In addition, you will need to make some slight change to how the box was built just to make some configuration changes. First, unplug the USB-C Power Cable from the back of the Kiloview and set it aside, then do the same for the 1ft Ethernet Cable in the front of the Kiloview.

* Next, grab an Ethernet Cable that is live with the network you can access and plug it into the Kiloview. Then take the Power Cable for the box itself and plug that into a nearby outlet. Finally,  turn the Kiloview on by flipping the switch on the back of the Kiloview from the right "OFF" position to the left "ON" position.
* If working properly, you should see the LED indicators on the Kiloview light up, including the Ethernet Port. Once completed, open your web browser on a local computer and move onto the next step/part.
