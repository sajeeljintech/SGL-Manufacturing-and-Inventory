# 5Ô∏è Part 5: Door Hardware

## Building the Fan Assembly

* There are not many parts that go on the case's door but it can still be tedious. Let's first tackle the _<mark style="color:red;">Fan Vent</mark>_ and _<mark style="color:red;">5 Volt (5V) Fan</mark>_.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1074 Medium.jpeg" alt="" width="360"><figcaption><p>The Fan Vent on the left, 5V Fan on the right</p></figcaption></figure>

* Unscrew the Fan Vent into 2 respective pieces: the _<mark style="color:red;">Vent</mark>_ and the _<mark style="color:red;">Ring</mark>._ On the outside of the case, place the Vent through the large hole with the exhaust facing down (as seen below). Now on the inside, take the Ring and tightly thread it back around the vent, taking note which of the Ring's screw holes is closest to the small hole above it.

* Next, place the 5V Fan over the screw holes of the Fan Vent, making sure the sticker is facing down. This will pull hot air out of the case instead of bringing more hot air into the hot case.
* Take your 4 Fan Screws and screw down the 5V Fan, also making sure the Fan's cable is close to the small hole. There may be 1 of the 4 screws that do not seem to tighten all the way, this is fine and still means the screw is set (as seen below). Once that is done you will have a built _<mark style="color:red;">Fan Assembly</mark>_

## Securing the Front Button

* Now that the Fan Assembly has been completed, time to make use of the small hole above it. The Front Buttons come with a nut to secure it down and may or may not include _<mark style="color:red;">O-Rings</mark>_ for them, if it does, place it at the neck of the Button (as shown below). You may be able to get away without an O-Ring, but in the instance where they do not come with one, it is recommended that you add one anyway.

<div data-full-width="true">

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1088 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Front Button with O-Ring</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* Once the Front Button has an O-Ring attached, place it through the front of the door so that the colored dots around the Button go Red, Green, Blue, then Black (from top-left clockwise). Thread down the included nut while maintaining the position of the Button. This should leave you with a flush Front Button and a completed _<mark style="color:red;">Door Assembly</mark>_, ready to connect to the V2 Pi Stack.
