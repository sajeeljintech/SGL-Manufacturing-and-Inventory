# 0Ô∏è Part 0: Modifying the Case

## Tools Needed

* Drill with screw in bit adapter
* 3/32" Drill Bit
* 3/8" Drill Bit
* 2" Hole Drill bit
* 1/2" Cone Drill Bit
* Pen for marking
* Template for Pi's mounting holes (dead M.2 Board for this use, but you may not be able to use one, in which I suggest carefully using a Pi or by creating a jig)
* Exacto-Knife (not pictured below)

## Parts Needed

* 12x12" Enclosure

## Prepping the Case

### Large Fan Hole

* Begin by marking the center of the interior of the case's door. There is already a circle from the molding process of manufacturing the case
* Using the 2" Bit, place the tip on the mark and CAREFULLY drill through to the other side
* Using an Exacto-Knife, trim around the edges of both sides of the newly created hole to make sure that the plastic does not cut the van vent's rubber seal later.

### Front Button Hole

* Begin by marking the location of the Front Button, slightly above the small square created by the molding process in manufacturing.
* Using the Cone Bit, carefully drill through the case all the way through.
* Again, use an Exacto-knife to clean up the edges of the newly created hole.

### Handheld Button Jack Hole

* Start by marking the location that you will be drilling into.
* This step is difficult. Drill through the foam using the 3/8" Drill Bit and into the plastic behind it. The drill may drift over to the side when tearing through the foam, which may cause problems later in the build. The example images below shows that the bit drifted to the right, which in-turn required additional modification to the case.
* Afterwards, use an Exacto-knife to clean up the inside edge of the case. Make sure to clear away as much plastic as possible, leaving the surface as flush as possible.

### Pi Stack Screw Holes

* Place yur jig of choice into the case, centered on the second square on the left, left as close as you can to the rail on the bottom of the grid system.
* Mark the location of the 4 holes needed for the 3/32" Drill Bit

* Using said 3/32" Bit, drill carefully into the case, making sure the holes made of straight down for proper security of the Pi Stack.
* Once completed, the case is ready for the next steps.
