# 7Ô∏è Part 7: Applying Stickers and Finishing Up

## Showgrounds LLC Sticker

* Start by placing the _<mark style="color:red;">Showgrounds LLC Sticker</mark>_ above the Front Button, peeling off one corner of the protective plastic, and rolling your finder over the sticker against the case as you slowly remove the backing.

## RVS Sticker

* Next is to tackle the _<mark style="color:red;">RVS Sticker</mark>_, but it breaks down to the same steps. Place the sticker below the fan vent and to the left of the Device Number Sticker. For best placement, the right of the RVS Sticker will slightly cover the Device Number Sticker, but none to worry, that portion of the sticker will not cover anything when the protective paper and plastic are removed.
* Remove the paper from under the sticker and make sure to press firmly down on the RVS letters. In this step, they are being adhered to the case.
* Finally, remove the plastic top later from the RVS Sticker carefully as to not remove the letters from the case. Give each letter a pass over with something like a credit card to get any obnoxious air bubbles out.

## Finished Product

* With that, the V2 Button Box has been fully built and is ready to be registered and configured. You may want to add a Post-it note to the front of the case for future reference.
