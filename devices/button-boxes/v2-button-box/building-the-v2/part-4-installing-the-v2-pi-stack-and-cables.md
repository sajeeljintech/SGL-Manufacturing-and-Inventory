# 4Ô∏è Part 4: Installing the V2 Pi Stack and Cables

## Installing the V2 Pi Stack

* The placement and installation of the V2 Pi Stack can be tricky as it has you standing the bottom of the case vertically as to be able to access each side of the case simultaneously.
* Start by getting your V2 Pi Stack and placing it on the diagonal M3 Screws we had placed in [Part 1 - Case Hole Screws](part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md#case-hole-screws). These will act as posts to line up the Stack and hold it in place as we swing the bottom of the case vertically.

* Next, firmly place your hand on the V2 Pi Stack and lift the bottom of the case (as seen below). While you can, use a screwdriver to finish installing the 2 diagonal M3 Case Screws and keep the Pi in place, then screw in the rest.

## Plugging in the Pi Stack Cables

#### There are many many cables that need to be connected to the V2 Pi Stack. Each cable has been broken down into sections in the following steps:

### The Flat USB Mini Cable and Ethernet Adapter

* Now that the V2 Pi Stack is not going anywhere, we can start plugging in everything. Beginning with the _<mark style="color:red;">Flat USB Mini Cable</mark>_ for the _<mark style="color:red;">M.2 Reader</mark>_, plug the USB Mini end in first, then bend it around to plug the USB B end into the Pi's bottom USB 2.0 port (as seen below).
* Then, take the cable from the [Part 1 - Ethernet Adapter](part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md#ethernet-adapter) and plug it into the Pi's bottom USB 3.0 port. The two different ports can be easily distinguished by their color USB 3.0 will (most of the time) be blue.

> To be noted: The Pi uses the same bus for each USB group (i.e. the USB 2.0 vs 3.0) but each port can have issues outside of that. We usually plug our Flat USB Mini Cable and Ethernet Adapter into the bottom ports but the top may work if the bottom doesn't. If both end up not working, then the Pi is broken and the Stack will need to be replaced.&#x20;

</div>

### The Ethernet Cable

* Adding the _<mark style="color:red;">1ft Ethernet Cable</mark>_ is quite simple. Take an end of the cable and plug it into the Pi then into the Kiloview E1-s with the other end.

</div>

### The Power Brick Cable

* Now that those cables have been set in place at the bottom of the V2 Pi Stack, run the Power Brick's cable beside the lower Unclipped Cable Saddle. Then slide the tied down bundle of cables under the Pi's cables (as shown below) with the plug routed out the right side. Leave the bundle of cables under the Pi while threading the plug end of the cable up through the Small Zip Tie we had placed in [Part 1 - Ethernet Adapter](part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md).
* The Kiloview has a threaded power port, so when plugging in the Power Brick cable, you will need to push the cable in while also threading the silver bolt around the plug (as shown below). Once tightened: leave enough slack for the plug to not be damaged and tie down the Small Zip Tie, cutting the excess when clicked as far down as possible.

</div>

### The USB C Power Cable

* In order to power the V2 Pi Stack, we take advantage of the USB ports on the back of the Kiloview. They provide enough power for the Pi and all of its' associated boards and cables. Below is the _<mark style="color:red;">USB C Power Cable</mark>_ we have been using for the build, start by removing the protective plastic from both the blue USB B and smaller USB C ends of the cable.

<div data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1054 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The USB C Cable we have been using</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1055 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Removing the plastic around the plugs</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* Because we do not use a custom length USB C cable to power the V2 Pi Stack, we will need to make sure each end of the cable has plenty of slack while also neatly arranging the extra cable. To do this, start by plugging in the USB C side of the USB C Power Cable into the Pi's left side. Again; making sure the plug is not being tugged to the left or right, the cable will be a little stiff so don't worry about the bend the USB C Power Cable makes as you route it around the left side of the power brick and round the top.
* Next, wrap the cable around a few times, checking to make sure the USB B end of the cable is still able to be inserted and still have some slack. Once you're happy about how the cable is organized, wrap a Small Zip Tie around the wrapped cable and the thick Power Cable so it does not jostle during use. Cut away and properly dispose of the plastic waste.&#x20;

### The Rainbow Door Cable

* In the V2 Button Box, there are a few items that go on the door of the case. To power and operate these items we use a flat rainbow cable, which we call the _<mark style="color:red;">Rainbow Door Cable</mark>_ (now referred to as the [Door Cable](../../../../custom-hardware/custom-buttons-and-cables/6-pin-rainbow-door-cable.md)) which uses 6 pins. Begin by positioning the cable with the blue cable is the top when the case is orientated correctly.
* On top of the Pi is a daughter board that we [design in house](../../../../custom-hardware/constellation-daughter-boards/big-dipper.md) called the _<mark style="color:red;">Big Dipper</mark>_. On the Big Dipper is a black 6 pin plug which can only be inserted when the cable is directed to the left of the V2 Pi Stack. It may be a tight fit so firmly slot the cable (with the blue side on top) into the port and route the cable through the loose Small Zip Tie from [Part 3 - Placing other Zip Ties](part-3-power-cable-management.md#placing-other-zip-ties). Finally, tuck the remaining amount of cable out of the way so it doesn't get damaged or in our way later.

### The Trigger Button Jack

#### Preparing the Cable

* There are two means of triggering the V2 Button Box to begin recording: the _<mark style="color:red;">Front Button</mark>_ or the _<mark style="color:red;">Trigger Button</mark>_. The Trigger Button is a separate device that is simply an external push button with a long 3.5mm cable attached to communicate to the V2 Pi Stack so operators do not need to be directly next to the Button Box when triggering a recording.
* We will need to add the ability for the V2 Button Box to receive signal from the Trigger Button. Start by removing the included silver nut from the [pre-assembled](../../../../custom-hardware/custom-buttons-and-cables/jst-trigger-button-jack.md) _<mark style="color:red;">JST Trigger Button Jack</mark>_ but keep it in an easy to remember place.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1064 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Removing the attached nut from the Jack</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

#### Inserting the Cable

* When preparing the case for the build process, it is likely that there is some extra spurring around the small hole, removing them with an _<mark style="color:red;">Exacto Knife</mark>_ will help keep the Jack flush to the outside of the case. This is necessary not only for keeping out potential contaminates, but means a small enough portion of the Trigger Button Jack's threading to tighten down the included silver nut.
* Run the JST end of the cable through the hole until the Jack is sealed against the case.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1068 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Jack completely flush to the outside of the case</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

#### Threading the Nut and Hot Glue

* Re-place the silver nut from before over the JST end of the cable to the Jack end. There it will be difficult but you should be able to thread the nut enough to keep the Trigger Button Jack in place during repeated use. To help reenforce the silver nut, use a small amount of hot glue as a seal around the outside of the Jack.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1069 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The silver nut being re-placed</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1072 Medium.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>A dollop of hot glue around the Jack</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* After the hot glue cools down, take the JST end of the cable and lead it through the same loose Small Zip Tie from [Part 3 - Placing Other Zip Ties](part-3-power-cable-management.md#placing-other-zip-ties). On top of the V2 Pi Stack's Big Dipper board is a small while JST plug with a one-way side facing the left side of the Pi. Finally, insert the JST cable and make sure everything is secure on both ends.
