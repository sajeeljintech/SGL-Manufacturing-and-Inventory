# 3Ô∏è Part 3: Power Cable Management

## Power Brick

* First and foremost, we will need to prepare the Kiloview's Power Brick for our needs. Start by sliding the US Adapter down from the top as demonstrated below.
* Next, untie the provided Tie and unfold both ends of the wrapped up cable _once_. Then re-tie the Bread Tie and wrap the remaining twist around itself. You should be left with a Power Brick that is slightly longer and still manageable.

* The awkward shape of the Power Brick means getting it secured to the case is difficult. Until we find a better alternative, we use small cut strips of _<mark style="color:red;">Velcro</mark>_ (both soft and rough sides). This allows us to still have the Power Brick tied down with Small Zip Ties and still have some shock absorption in the instant of a fall and still have the capability of removing the Brick for repairs.
* Cut a small strip of Velcro together and remove one side's protective plastic. Place the strip in the middle of the Power Brick, making sure it likes up with the prongs. Once placed, press down on the Velcro then remove the second side's protective plastic.
* Take out the Power Cable from [Part 2A - Power Cable](part-2-installing-the-kiloview/part-2a-prep-and-installation.md#power-cable) and plug it into the Power Brick.

## Attached Power Cable

* The placement of the Power Brick and attached Power Cable is precise (now referred as just the _<mark style="color:red;">Power Cable</mark>_). Below is a demonstration of how the Power Cable needs to route from the bottom right of the case, to the right of the Kiloview, and bends to the left until it meets the left wall of the case. There, press the Velcro into the top large rail of the case. This ensures the neck of the Power Cable is neatly aligned with an Unclipped Cable Saddle placed in [Part 2B - Cable Management Saddles](part-2-installing-the-kiloview/part-2b-secure-the-kiloview.md#cable-management-saddles). Keep the Power cable resting along the channel and down through the foam of the case.

## Placing Power Cable Zip Ties

* Now that the Power Cable has been placed properly, we need to make sure it does not go anywhere. Start by threading a Small Zip Tie through both gates of the Unclipped Cable Saddle and under the Power Cable's neck. Zip it down tight, this will anchor it for now as you work around the case.

</div>

* After attaching the first Small Zip Tie to the Power Cable, move to the right following the Power Cable to the other Unclipped Cable Saddle. Place a Small Zip Tie under the Power Cable and through the top gate of the Cable Saddle (as seen below). While the Power Cable is placed in the middle of the Unclipped Cable Saddle, tie down the Small Zip Tie with a very small amount of slack for the rest of the cable to the left.
* Then, send a second Small Zip Tie through the bottom gate of the Cable Saddle and Zip it down 2 or 3 clicks. This second Zip Tie is for any future operators of the V2 who want to tie down the ethernet we provide to them and have a clear channel for the cable to run down to relieve it of strain.

</div>

* Moving down the Power Cable brings us to the third Unclipped Cable Saddle where you need to thread another Small Zip Tie though the right side gate. Before fully zipping down the Tie, make sure to give the bend of the cable a good amount of slack to help keep the cable in good condition for longer.

</div>

## Placing Other Zip Ties

* Now with the Power Cable attached fully to the case, we can move into the last 2 Small Zip Ties in this part. Begin with the top Unclipped Cable Saddle, thread the Small Zip Tie through the right gate and zip down the loose Power Brick cable.
* Then, thread the second Small Zip Tie through both gates of the bottom Unclipped Cable Saddle and zip them together with 2-3 clicks as we will need this later to lightly hold a few cables in [Part 6 - Zipping Down Loose Tie](part-6-little-dipper-assembly-and-connection.md#zipping-down-loose-tie).

* Once all the Zip Ties have been places, remove the excess from all of the _Fully Zipped Ties_ as we will need the spare lead on the rest for later. Dispose of the trash properly.

## Wrapping the Power Cable

* Finally, grab the end of the Power Cable and secure a _<mark style="color:red;">Velcro Tie</mark>_ (seen below) right above the cable tags. Then, fold the cable up, following the creases made from the factory all the way up to the case, then take the Velcro Tie and wrap it around the coiled cable to keep the cable off the floor and neatly protected.
