# üÖ±Ô∏è Part 2B: Secure the Kiloview

## Kiloview Ties

### Zip Ties

* The way to secure the Kiloview to the case without any adhesives is a bit convoluted but will make sure it doesn't come loose after heat/sun exposure as it was in the past. Start by snuggly placing the Kiloview between all of the Half Clipped Cable Saddles and double check there is little wiggle room with the Large Zip Ties, then bring the top Large Zip Tie over the encoder to tighten it to the bottom Large Zip Tie **(1)**. It will be difficult to keep the Kiloview to the case as the Zip Ties are slightly elastic like this and will try to pull the encoder up.
* Tighten the bottom Large Zip Tie most of the way **(2)**. Remember that you can always pull tighter, not as much the other way. Press the bottom Tie to the Kiloview at the 90 degree angle made earlier and keep it there for a moment. Now on the top, pull out any extra slack under the Kiloview **(3)**. With the slack taken care of, press the top Large Zip Tie to the Kiloview case **(4)** and with your other hand tighten down the top Tie to the other 90 degree angle as seen below **(5)**.
* Finally, pull again on the bottom Large Zip Tie to remove all the slack. If done correctly, the Kiloview should not move when wiggled on the tightened side and the Large Zip Tie on top will be nice and flat **(6)**. Repeat the 6 mini-steps for the other side.

### Bread Tie

* Now with the Kiloview in place, we need to make sure the Ties that are close to the edge do not slide off while in use or transit. Flip the case to so you are facing the top of the Kiloview. Using the salvaged Bread Tie from [Part 2A - Power Cable](part-2a-prep-and-installation.md#power-cable), thread it through the secured Zip Ties and pull them together (shown below).

* Once in place, thread the Bread Tie back on itself between the Tie and the Kiloview (shown below). This will create just enough of a knot to not undo itself over time and be easily removable for future repairs. On the other side, pull the Bread Tie to remove any extra slack and make sure the Zip Ties closest to the edge are away from said edge.
* Tie the Bread Tie like you did on the previous side. With that, both Large Zip Tie Ties have to move together when experiencing any stress or shock to the case.

* To finish securing the Kiloview, rotate the case back to how we have been working on it and place an Unclipped Cable Saddle on same row as the first Unclipped Cable Saddle in [Part 1](../part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md)[ - Ethernet Adapter](../part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md#ethernet-adapter) as close as possible to the encoder. That Saddle is the last to place for the installation of the Kiloview. Make sure everything is snug in place and does not wiggle a lot when moved.

* Next, remove all the excess tie hanging off of the Large Zip Ties and Salvaged Bread Tie. The trash builds up in this build so make sure all of the little scraps are being taken care of and removed properly.&#x20;

## Cable Management Saddles

* Once completed, use 4 Unclipped Cable Saddles and place them in the locations shown below. The first two are at the left side of the case on the bottom 2 small rows in-between the 2 left-most columns. The last 2 are place on the large case rail above the Kiloview. Location is very important for these. The Unclipped Cable Saddle on the left should be slightly to the left of the column holding the Ethernet Adapter's Fully Clipped Cable Saddle. The Unclipped Cable Saddle on the right should be placed below the left-side of the oval indent made for the case's legs. Both are seen below.
