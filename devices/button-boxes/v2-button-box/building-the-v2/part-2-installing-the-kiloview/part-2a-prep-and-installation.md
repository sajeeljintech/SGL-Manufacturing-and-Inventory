# üÖ∞Ô∏è Part 2A: Prep and Installation

## Power Cable

* Before we start with the _<mark style="color:red;">Kiloview E1-s Encoder</mark>_ (will be addressed as the Kiloview from here on) we must prepare our _<mark style="color:red;">Power Cable</mark>_. Start by removing the Power Cable from its' plastic packaging and remove the zip tied warning tag. Untie the _<mark style="color:red;">Bread Tie</mark>_ and keep it aside for later in [Part 2B - Bread Tie](part-2b-secure-the-kiloview.md#bread-tie).

## Device Number Sticker

* While we are here outside the case, it's a good idea to add the _<mark style="color:red;">Device Number Sticker</mark>_ to the front. There is a specific place to put them in the bottom right of the case's face.

## Kiloview Unboxing

* Now that we have specific number for this device we will need to make sure the Kiloview used with this V2 is tracked properly. After removing the plastic wrap from the Kiloview's packaging, mark a _<mark style="color:red;">Post-It Note</mark>_ with the 4 digit device number. Keep the Post-It with that box as it contains the serial number of the Encoder.

</div>

* Inside the Kiloview E1-s' packaging is first a layer of protected foam and the Kiloview inside some anti-static plastic. Remove the Encoder and look underneath the included documentation (you may want to keep the paper just in case there is a problem and want to use the included warranty card) to find the _<mark style="color:red;">Kiloview Power Brick</mark>_ and the _<mark style="color:red;">US Wall Adapter</mark>_ that comes with it. Once you have the 3 items set aside for the build, place the packaging with the Post-It Note to the side (or with the other Kiloview packages).

## Kiloview Installing

* As we move to installing the Kiloview we will need to make sure we are being safe to the equipment. Although it may be overkill, have an _<mark style="color:red;">Anti-Static Mat</mark>_ or workstation to protect any hardware from unexpected damage. In order to secure the Kiloview we will need 4 Half Clipped Cable Saddles with Screws and the Bread Tie we had set aside from the Power Cable.

</div>

* To start securing the Kiloview, start by setting the first Half Clipped Cable Saddle in the 5th column from the right, snug against the bottom large saddle rail. Repeat with the 2nd Half Clipped Cable Saddle in the 2nd column from the right. Once those 2 are done, place the Kiloview with the logo facing up and the SDI ports facing down against the bottom 2 Saddles and touching the first Cable Saddle we placed in [Part 1 - Ethernet Adapter](../part-1-prep-and-the-ethernet-adapter.md#ethernet-adapter).

</div>

* Once you're done with the bottom set, move to the top of the Kiloview and place 2 more Half Clipped Cable Saddles parallel to the first 2 but with the gates facing the same way. It will be quite a tight fit but this will make sure the Kiloview does not move in transit without using adhesives.

</div>

* In order to properly secure the Kiloview, you will need 4 _<mark style="color:red;">Large 40lbs Zip Ties</mark>_. The first 2 need to be placed through the gates of the parallel Half Clipped Cable Saddles (as seen below). Then attach the remaining 2 Large Zip Ties onto the ends of the first 2 Zip Ties demonstrated with a small gif below. You will only need to have it click into place a few times for now.
